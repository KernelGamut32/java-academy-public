## Week 02 Homework

<u>Task 01</u>

* Create a Java program that prompts the user for two double precision numbers.  Then, display results of performing four different  mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  An example trace of your program's console might be:

```
Enter 1st number: 15.5
Enter 2nd number: 1.55
15.5 + 1.55 = 17.05
15.5 - 1.55 = 13.95
15.5 * 1.55 = 24.025
15.5 / 1.55 = 10
```

* For an added challenge, modify the program to use `BigDecimal`

<u>Task 02</u>

* Create a Java program that prompts the user for a string name (ex: Ralph Westly, Ezra Aiden Pliers) and then parses it into components of a name (first name, middle name, and last name).  Allow the user to continue as long as they like. An example trace of your program's console might be:

```
Enter a name: Ezra Aiden Pliers
First name: Ezra
Middle name: Aiden
Last name: Pliers
Do you want to enter another (y/n)? y
Enter a name: Ralph Westly
First name: Ralph
Middle name: (none)
Last name: Westly
Do you want to enter another (y/n)? n
```

<u>Task 03</u>

* Create a Java application that prompts the user for an integer test score in the range 0-100 and then assigns a letter grade (A-F).  The scoring criteria is 90-100 is an A, 80-89 is a B, 70-79 is a C, 60-69 is a D, and under 60 is an F.  An example trace of your program's console might be:

```
Enter a test score: 82
Your letter grade is a B
```

<u>Task 04</u>

* Create a Java program that loops from -500 to +500 and prints out
  all numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 7.  Do this with a for loop
  and a while loop.

<u>Task 05</u>

* Modify the Java program from Task 04 to print out a count of the numbers between -
  500 to +500 that are divisible by either 3 or 7.
