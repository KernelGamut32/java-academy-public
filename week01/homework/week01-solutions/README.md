## Week 01 Homework

<u>Task 01</u>

* Create a Java program to output a high-level bio for yourself. Include display of things like the following:
    * Name
    * Favorite food
    * Hobbies
    * Answer to this question: “If I could choose to be any animal, I would be a _____________” (fill in the blank with your choice in the program’s output)
    * Anything else you want to include

<u>Task 02</u>

Pick a recipe from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/. Replicate the recipe in a Java program that displays the recipe details in a terminal. Experiment with different formatting options for your display to ensure that the display is as user-friendly as possible (including formatting of numbers, spacing, etc.).

You do not have to display everything in the recipe - just pick a representative set of detail to allow sufficient exploration of display and formatting options in your Java code.

<u>Task 03</u>

Using the programs from Task 01 and Task 02, experiment with the various Maven commands in your application for building and packaging your code.
