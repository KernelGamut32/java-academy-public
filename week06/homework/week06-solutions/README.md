## Week 06 Homework

* In this program, you will reuse the class hierarchy and collection created in the previous exercise (from week05 homework):
    * Use streams and lambdas to filter your collection of employees by a specific name
    * Use streams and lambdas to filter your collection of employees by a portion of a name (contains characters)
    * Create a custom comparator that allows you to sort your collection of employees by yearly salary and demonstrate its usage via lambda/stream
    * Create a custom comparator that allows you to sort your collection of employees by weekly salary in descending order and demonstrate its usage via lambda/stream
    * Execute an operation against your collection of employees that returns a summary object for each employee that contains only job title and yearly salary
    * Feel free to try other lambda/stream operations using https://github.com/JimmyMick/JavaFilterMapReduce for examples of the types of operations possible against your employee collection and to help you with proper syntax
