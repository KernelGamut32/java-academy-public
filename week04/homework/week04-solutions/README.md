## Week 04 Homework

<u>Task 01</u>

* Create a Java application that works with a list of employees.  Begin by creating a class named Employee that includes:
    * Private fields: name, jobTitle, and yearlySalary
    * A constructor to initialize them
    * A getter method for each field
    * A getter method that returns weekly salary (divide yearly salary by 52)
    * A method that displays the employee (name, job title, and weekly salary)
    * Optionally setter methods for the name, jobTitle, and yearlySalary fields 
* Then create an array with 4 employees pre-loaded with test data
* Loop through your array and display each employee (using the toString/display method)

<u>Task 02</u>

* Enhance your solution for task 01 to utilize partitioning in your application (domain, DAO, service, and app with entry point)
* Feel free to use the example solution (courses) as a model
* Include JUnit tests for your service (like in the example)
